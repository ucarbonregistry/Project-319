76 MW Wind Power Project by Uttar Urja Projects Private Limited (UCR ID Number: 319)
______________
The project titled “76 MW Wind Power Project by Uttar Urja Projects Private Limited.”is a
grid connected wind power project located in various village in the state of Madhya Pradesh (India).
The purpose of this plant installation and power generation to Madhya Pradesh Power
Management Company Limited. M/s Uttar Urja Projects Pvt. Ltd. has the full ownership of the
project activity. The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG,
currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).
The project activity harnesses kinetic energy of wind (renewable source) to generate electricity.
The project activity which incorporates installation and operation of 38 Wind Turbine
Generators (WTGs) having individual capacity of 2 MW. Thus, the total aggregated installed
capacity is 76 MW is operational in Piploda and Daloada Tehsil of Ratlam and Mandsaur
Districts in the state of Madhya Pradesh (India). Thus, the project activity contributes to
emission reductions which would have otherwise caused due to the consumption of grid
electricity which is predominantly fossil fuel based. 
_______________________
The project activity was developed as a greenfield activity with no power generation facility
existing at the project site in the pre project scenario. In the pre project scenario equivalent
amount of electricity would have been generated and supplied from grid for the purpose of
consumption, thus the power displaced by the project activity would have been otherwise
generated from fossil fuel dominated thermal power plant and fed to the grid which is the
current baseline for the project.
Hence, project activity is displacing the estimated annual net electricity generation i.e., 156454
MWh from the grid (currently part of Unified Indian National Grid system), which
otherwise, would have been generated from fossil fuel based thermal power plant and exported
to the national grid.
The project activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources. The expected emission
reduction by the project activity is expected to be 1023849.504 tCO2 ,whereas actual emission
reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be submitted as a of first monitoring and
verification of first monitoring and verification.
Since the project activity will generate electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable
energy source it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes
to climate change mitigation efforts.
